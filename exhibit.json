'Level3' is the greatest spot density, that is, a pixel with the largest number of RNA spots underneath it. Note that the **n** levels can be condensed into one mask, e.g., the mouse dev gene expression masks. That was not done here in the interest of time. It's a post-Minerva Author step done with a custom Python script to collapse different masks together.\nThe concern here was that having each pixel being the same color, regardless of the number of RNA spots at that location, would make a blob. We wanted to test out a heatmap, similar to this image:\n ![image](img/RNA_spot_density_heatmap.png) This is still in development.\n\nNote we can distinguish fiducials where RNA spots are excluded.
